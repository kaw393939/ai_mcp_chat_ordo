# Chapter 9 — AI-Native Interfaces: Designing for Probabilistic Systems

## Abstract
AI-native interfaces break the fundamental contract of traditional UI: determinism. When a user clicks a button, they expect the same result every time. When a user prompts an LLM, they get a probabilistic response that may vary. This chapter examines the new interaction patterns emerging for conversational, agent-driven, and tool-augmented interfaces — and the design principles required to maintain user trust in non-deterministic systems.

## The Determinism Problem

Traditional UI is deterministic: the same input produces the same output. Clicking "Sort by date" always sorts by date. Typing "apple" in a search box always searches for "apple."

LLM-powered interfaces are *stochastic*: the same input may produce different outputs. Temperature, context window, model version, and system prompt all influence the response. This introduces a new category of user experience: **the same prompt might work perfectly today and fail tomorrow.**

This is not a bug — it is a fundamental property of the medium. UI design for AI-native systems must acknowledge this property and design around it, not pretend it doesn't exist.

## The Chat Interface Pattern

The most common AI-native interface is the chat pattern: a scrollable message history with a text input at the bottom. This pattern was established by messaging apps (iMessage, WhatsApp) and adopted for AI interactions (ChatGPT, Claude).

### What the Chat Pattern Gets Right
- **Turn-taking**: clear visual distinction between user input and system response
- **Context**: conversation history is visible, providing context for both user and model
- **Progressive disclosure**: responses stream in, maintaining perceived responsiveness

### What the Chat Pattern Gets Wrong
- **Discoverability**: users don't know what the system *can* do until they ask
- **Editability**: correcting a previous prompt requires re-sending, not editing in place
- **Structure**: complex outputs (tables, code, diagrams) are awkwardly embedded in linear chat

### Hybrid Interfaces
The emerging pattern combines chat with **structured UI elements**: the model can return not just text but interactive components — forms, charts, configuration panels, action buttons. The interface adapts its structure to the content of the response.

## Trust Indicators for Non-Deterministic Output

Because AI output varies, users need signals about *confidence* and *provenance*:

| Signal | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Source attribution | Where the information came from (citations, links) |
| Confidence indicator | How certain the model is (when available) |
| Regenerate button | Allow the user to get a different response |
| Edit prompt | Allow the user to refine their input |
| Explicit model label | Which model version generated the response |

The principle: **transparency is the replacement for determinism.** When you cannot guarantee the same output every time, you must instead guarantee that the user understands *how* the output was generated and can take corrective action.

## Tool-Augmented Interfaces (MCP and Beyond)

When AI systems can invoke external tools (calculators, databases, APIs), the interface must communicate *what the model is doing and why*:

- **Tool invocation transparency**: show which tool was called, with what inputs
- **Result verification**: show the tool's output before the model interprets it
- **Audit trail**: maintain a visible log of all tool invocations for accountability

This connects directly to the governance principles in Book I (Chapter 9): tool invocations are deterministic checkpoints in a probabilistic workflow. They are the "evidence layer" that prevents AI-native systems from becoming black boxes.

## What This Means for Us

AI-native interfaces require new design primitives:
- **Streaming response rendering** (not waiting for complete output)
- **Confidence and attribution metadata** (not hiding model limitations)
- **Tool transparency** (not abstracting away what the model does)
- **Graceful degradation** (not crashing when the model returns unexpected output)

The traditional UI contract (deterministic, predictable, repeatable) is being replaced by a new contract: *transparent, auditable, and correctable*.

## Chapter Checklist
- Does your AI interface stream responses to maintain perceived responsiveness?
- Can users regenerate, edit, or refine their prompts?
- Are tool invocations visible and auditable?
- Does the interface communicate model identity and confidence?
- Is there a clear visual distinction between AI-generated content and system-verified content?
- Does the interface degrade gracefully when the model returns unexpected output?
